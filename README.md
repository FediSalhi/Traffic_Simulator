This project is a traffic simulation in which vehicles are moving along streets and are crossing intersections equipped with a traffic light. 
The project was built for the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) fourth course as an application of C++ concurrent programming techniques, such as:
- Message queues
- Locks
- Mutexes
- Condition variables
- Threads and tasks
